# Getting Started with Linux and AWS for Beginners

Welcome to this beginner-friendly guide on learning Linux and AWS. This repository is built from training material and designed for people with **no prior IT experience**. Each folder covers a topic using simple explanations, real-world analogies, mini-quizzes, diagrams, and hands-on examples.

It now includes projects and walkthroughs aligned with **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** and **AWS Solutions Architect - Associate** certification objectives.

## üõçÔ∏è Who is this for?
- **Beginners** who want to start learning Linux and AWS tools
- **Job seekers** pursuing cloud, DevOps, or IT support roles
- **Students** or career changers exploring infrastructure
- **AWS certification candidates** preparing for Cloud Practitioner or Associate-level exams

## üí° What will you learn?
You'll learn how to:
- Use Linux commands to navigate and manage a system
- Launch and connect to AWS virtual machines (EC2)
- Secure cloud servers and transfer files
- Manage users, install software, and more
- Configure IAM users, policies, and permissions
- Host a static website on S3
- Launch and harden EC2 instances with SSH and Security Groups
- Set budgets and track AWS Free Tier usage
- Understand VPC, subnets, routing, and network isolation
- Use Terraform and JSON IAM policies
- Leverage AWS Management Tools like Systems Manager, CloudWatch, and CloudTrail to automate, monitor, and secure workloads
- Work with Docker containers and images for isolated, portable applications
- Use Git and GitHub for source control, collaboration, and version history
- Write simple Python scripts to automate tasks and interact with cloud APIs
- Query cloud databases using SQL fundamentals (SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, etc.)
- Deploy and scale applications using **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** and **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)**
- Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** for EC2 health and metrics
- Design highly available architectures with **multi-AZ deployments**
- Use **EFS** for scalable, shared file storage between EC2s

## ‚è±Ô∏è When should you use this?
- While preparing for AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP) or Solutions Architect ‚Äì Associate exams
- During technical interviews that involve Linux or AWS CLI
- As reference during IT training or bootcamps

## üåç Where does this apply?
- **Linux-based systems** (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, etc.)
- **AWS Cloud platform** ‚Äî especially EC2, S3, IAM, RDS, VPC, and CLI

## ‚ùì Why Linux and AWS?
- Linux powers most cloud servers and devices
- AWS is the most widely used cloud provider
- Both are foundational to modern IT and cloud careers

## üîß How to Use This Repository
1. **Download or clone the repo**
2. Pick a folder you're interested in (start with [`1_basic-linux-commands/`](./1_basic-linux-commands/))
3. Open the `.sh` script or `.md` guide inside
4. Read the comments and run the examples in your terminal or AWS CloudShell

Each script is explained line-by-line with real-life comparisons. Every subfolder also includes a `README.md` with beginner-friendly lessons, examples, analogies, quizzes, checklists, troubleshooting tips, and a visual diagram.
